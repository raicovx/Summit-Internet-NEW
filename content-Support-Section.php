		<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="mdi-action-info-outline"></i>What is the correct way to remove a program from my computer?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body">
<p>The best way is to go to Control Panel/Add remove programs. Find the program you wish to remove, click on it and follow the on screen directions. If the program is not there you can check to see if there is an uninstall option when you go to the Program itself or in the start menu options for that program. As a last resort, you can move the program folder to the recycle bin but this will not totally remove it and may cause problems. Leave it on the computer if space allows.</p>

      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>The act of defragmenting a hard drive. When you defragment a hard drive you use a software utility to arrange the order of your files so that each file is represented in a physically continuous segment. Defragmentation can improve your hard drive performance because it can read any particular file in a continuous stream instead of jumping here and there around a hard drive to locate each file segment or fragment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>First we should ask what is a cookie?</b></p>
<p>Cookies are small files that Web sites put on your computer hard disk drive when you first visit. Think of a cookie as an identification card that’s uniquely yours. Its job is to notify the site when you’ve returned. Cookies should not be confused with viruses. While it is possible to misuse a cookie in cases where there is personal data in it, cookies by themselves are not malicious. Many Web sites, including Microsoft’s, use cookies. Cookies tell us how often you visit pages, which helps us find out what information interests you. In this way, we can give you more of the content you like and less of the content you don’t. Cookies can help you be more efficient. Have you ever put something in a virtual shopping cart in an online store and then returned a few days later to find that the item is still there? That’s an example of cookies at work. Cookies let you store preferences and user names, register products and services, and personalize pages. But if you never register or leave personal information at a site, then the server only knows that someone with your cookie has returned to the Web site. It doesn’t know anything else. You’re in charge of deciding whether we know anything about you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Why are cookies blocked on Summit Internet Usage page?</b></p>
<p>This is a good thing as some web site could contain nasty virus or pose a security risk to the information on your machine. So by default this option is turned off. But unfortunately this also means that safe web sites are also block from displaying their safe content. &nbsp;By allowing cookies on the Summit Internet Usage page you are only allowing the safe content to be displayed on this web page not other web pages that could potential have nasty content within the web sites.</p>

		<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="mdi-action-info-outline"></i>What is a Virus?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Computer viruses are small software programs that are designed to spread from one computer to another and to interfere with computer operation. A virus might corrupt or delete data on your computer, use your e-mail program to spread itself to other computers, or even erase everything on your hard disk. Computer viruses are often spread by attachments in e-mail messages or instant messaging messages. That is why it is essential that you never open e-mail attachments unless you know who it’s from and you are expecting it. Viruses can be disguised as attachments of funny images, greeting cards, or audio and video files. Computer viruses also spread through downloads on the Internet. They can be hidden in inactive software or other files or programs you might download. To help avoid computer viruses, it’s essential that you keep your computer current with the latest updates and antivirus tools, stay informed about recent threats, run your computer as a standard user (not as administrator), and that you follow a few basic rules when you surf the Internet, download files, and open attachments. Once a virus is on your computer, its type or the method it used to get there is not as important as removing it and preventing further infection.</p>

		<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="mdi-action-info-outline"></i>What is a Computer Worm?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>A computer worm is a software program that is designed to copy itself from one computer to another, without human interaction. Unlike a computer virus, a worm can copy itself automatically. Worms can replicate in great volume. For example, a worm can send out copies of itself to every contact in your e-mail address book, and then it can send itself to all of the contacts your contact’s e-mail address books. Some worms spread very quickly. They clog networks and can cause long waits for you (and everyone else) to view Web pages on the Internet.</p>

		<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="mdi-action-info-outline"></i>What is Spyware?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Spyware is a general term used to describe software that performs certain behaviors, generally without appropriately obtaining your consent first, such as:</p>
		  <blockquote style="margin-left:25px">
		  	Advertising
	<br>
Collecting personal information
<br>
Changing the configuration of your computer
		  </blockquote>
<p>spyware is often associated with software that displays advertisements (called adware) or software that tracks personal or sensitive information.</p>

<p><b>Trading tracking for services</b><br>
That does not mean all software that provides ads or tracks your online activities is bad. For example, you might sign up for a free music service, but you “pay” for the service by agreeing to receive targeted ads. If you understand the terms and agree to them, you may have decided that it is a fair tradeoff. You might also agree to let the company track your online activities to determine which ads to show you.</p>
<p><b>What spyware does</b><br>
Other kinds of spyware make changes to your computer that can be annoying and can cause your computer slow down or crash.</p>
<p>These programs can change your Web browser's home page or search page, or add additional components to your browser you don't need or want. They also make it very difficult for you to change your settings back to the way you had them.</p>
<p><b>Know what you're installing</b></p>
<p>The key in all cases is whether or not you (or someone who uses your computer) understand what the software will do and have agreed to install the software on your computer. A common trick is to covertly install the software during the installation of other software you want such as a music or video file sharing program. Whenever you install something on your computer, make sure you carefully read all disclosures, including the license agreement and privacy statement. Sometimes the inclusion of unwanted software in a given software installation is documented, but it might appear at the end of a license agreement or privacy statement.There are a number of ways spyware or other unwanted software can get on your computer.</p>
