<p><b>Q:</b> Have you always been involved in the IT (Information Technology) business?<br>
No, I've been in IT since 1985 but prior to than I spent 10 years in the landscaping industry. Prior to that I was enlisted in the Australian Navy and during that time received an Admiral's commendation for Seamanship for assisting the floundering vessel MV Holien off Newcastle harbour.</p>
<b>Q:</b> How do you like to relax when you're not working?<br>
There's nothing better than catching up on some sleep, playing with my Grandchildren, watching a good movie or reading the paper. Typical male things really!<br><br>
<b>Q:</b> Are you ruled by your heart or your head?<br>
I am often ruled by my heart but my hip pocket (or my head) keeps me in line.<br><br>
